# Stories

Stories are work packets. They turn product intent into bounded implementation
and validation work.

Current product packets:

- [`US-001 Intelligent Inventory Dashboard Foundation`](US-001-intelligent-inventory-dashboard-foundation.md)
  is implemented and owns the validated production MVP proof.
- [`US-002 Basic Design Foundation`](US-002-basic-design-foundation.md) is
  implemented and owns the completed design milestone.

## Normal Story

Use `docs/templates/story.md` for normal feature work.

Suggested path:

```text
docs/stories/epics/E01-domain-name/US-001-short-story-title.md
```

## High-Risk Story

Use `docs/templates/high-risk-story/` when the feature intake classifies work as
high-risk.

Suggested path:

```text
docs/stories/epics/E02-risky-domain/US-012-risky-story-title/
  execplan.md
  overview.md
  design.md
  validation.md
```

## Status Flow

```text
planned -> in_progress -> implemented
                  |
                  v
               changed
                  |
                  v
               retired
```
